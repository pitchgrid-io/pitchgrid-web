## Introduction

Welcome to PitchGrid, an innovative and powerful tool for the open-minded (or, rather, open-eared) composer who wants to master the art of building scales (and play them). 

![PitchGridPluginUI](images/PitchGridPluginUI.png "1100")

_Fig 1. Interface of the PitchGrid Plugin_ 

This guide starts with an informative section "The Art of Building Scales" which attempts to motivate the existence of PitchGrid. It is followed by a tour through the interface and a description of its mode of operation. The last section deals with setup instructions and useful tips. 

## The Art of Building Scales

There is a continuum of frequencies. Which of them should we play? 

A scale is a set of frequencies that a musician might want to play, together with a naming convention for the individual frequencies. We call them notes, and the frequencies become the pitches of the notes. 

The Western diatonic scale is just one out of an infinite number of possible scales. PitchGrid aims to make many of them easily accessible for exploration, understanding and music making.

Every scale features its own characteristic set of interval relationships between its notes. This interval structure stronly influences the sound and taste of the music that is possible within that given scale system. The art of building scales is also called tuning theory. PitchGrid is a tuning theory plugin.

The necessity to have tuning theories arises from the fundamental and inherent incompatibily between two important aspects of pitch intervals in music, Justness and Regularity. But considering tuning theories also has richness and beauty to it. So let's explore these two aspects and how they interact.

1. **Justness**: (Sensory) consonance of an interval is achieved at particular frequency ratios. For tones having a harmonic spectrum, consonance is achieved when the ratio of frequencies is a ratio of small integers. The smaller the integers, the stronger the feeling of consonance. The underlying assumption is that a tone has a harmonic spectrum, that is to say, its partials’ frequencies are integer multiples of its fundamental‘s frequency. The ratio also tells us which of the overtones have the same frequency, i.e. resonate, if the two tone‘s defining fundamental frequencies are at that ratio. This resonance is what is most responsible for the sensation of consonance. You hear that the two tones fit, or hug, when some of the lower overtones match in frequency. The smaller the integers in the ratio, the stronger the feeling of consonance, because it is lower, and thus louder, overtones which paticipate in the resonance. An interval equal to a ratio of integers is called **_just_**. 
2. **Regularity**: The appeal of tonal music largely derives from recognizing a musical phrase. This makes repetition the most important (and maybe defining)feature of music that most humans enjoy listening to. Since exact repetition becomes boring, a voiced musical phrase is often altered upon repetition, introducing an element of surprise. One such alteration device is transposition (i.e. the shift of the frequency of the phrase pattern as a whole). Thus, having scales that feature note pitches which enable transposition is a feature that composers and musicians naturally desire. A scale which enables transposition naturally becomes **_regular_**.

A scale (any scale) cannot have both properties at the same time, being composed of just intervals only and being maximally regular. Much of tuning theory arises from and adresses this incompatibility. Every scale that has been built to support tonal music is a compromise between justness and regularity. The PitchGrid concept makes this aspect explicit. 

Traditional approaches to tuning theory start with justness, i.e. by selecting a set of just intervals as the foundation of a just intonation (JI) scale, and then finding the ways in which the note's pitches can be tweaked (tempered) in order to achieve regularity. A scale modified in this way is also referred to as a temperament.

PitchGrid breaks with this tradition by turning the process around.

### The PitchGrid Path to Tuning Theory

Start with a regular scale and see which just intervals it can best approximate. 

The big advantage of this (turned-around) approach is that a regular scale can be easily parametrized. The core of the PitchGrid plugin thus is a set of knobs which potentially alter all the pitches at the same time, while always maintaining the desired regularity. You need not have any tuning theory knowledge, just tweak the tuning as you would tweak knobs on a synth, and see what sounds good for you.

Now, the strictest form of regularity is having only one interval size between consecutive scale degrees (step sizes). They are also called rank-1 regular temperaments. As the 2:1 ratio is the strongest consonance of all, the most popular rank-1 scales are equal divisions of the octave (EDOs). These require the biggest sacrifice in terms of justness, but at the same time offer two handy features: 1. They make the spiral of fifths to close into a circle, and 2. They enable consistently tuned fretted instruments. The most prominent example of a rank-1 regular temperament, of course, is the 12-TET, the twelve note scale which we are culturally most familiar with.

Next in the hierarchy by degree of regularity are so-called rank-2 regular temperaments. These feature all scales having two different step sizes. The 1/4-comma Meantone temperament of the diatonic scales is the most prominent example, heavily used in renaissance and early baroque music to tune organs and hapsicords. Rank-2 regular temperaments allow much better approximations of just intervals than rank-1, which is the main motivation for using them. It is a compromise, a middle ground between justness and regularity. They give up the closing of the circle of fifths, but otherwise maintain regularity, while enabling scales in which the intervals are much closer to justness.

This is the space that PitchGrid makes accessible. The Western diatonic scale, with its two (equally distributed) step sizes, along with all its structural features such as the church modes and the implied notation system we use in sheet music, serves as a prototype. Historically important regular tunings of the diatonic scale, such as Pythagorean tuning, all Meantone temperaments, but also rank-1 EDOs hosting the diatonic scale such as 19-EDO, 22-EDO, 31-EDO etc., along with all the church modes, can instantly be reproduced in PitchGrid by simply turning knobs. 

But having five large and two small steps distributed equally (the defining feature of the Western diatonic scale) is just one possibility. The tuning theoretician Erv Wilson explored the space of all possible scales which feature two different step sizes distributed equally, and called these scales the Moments of Symmetry (or MOS, for short). MOS-scales, then, is what PitchGrid is mostly about, which is why PitchGrid is devoted to Erv Wilson.

Regularity in two dimensions implies that the best instruments to play PitchGrid scales are two dimensional isomorphic keyboards. But because our frame of reference is the Western musical tradition with its piano keyboard (and since everybody has a piano controller), the PitchGrid maps notes to that type of controller, first and foremost. (It is possible to make the PitchGrid plugin very useful for designated isomorphic controllers, as well. More on that later.)

Let us now give an overview of the PitchGrid Plugins user interface and describe its basic mode of operation.

## Overview and Operation

At its core is the PitchGrid — a visual, two dimensional lattice representation of musical intervals that allows you to map a large variety of scales and tunings to your controller. This intuitive interface lets you understand the relationships between the scale degrees and frequency ratios and to intuitively explore a huge space of tuning systems and their structural and harmonic possibilities.


### Interface Walkthrough


![PitchGridPluginUI](images/PG_Interface_12TET.png "1100")

Let us first break down the different areas of the PitchGrid Plugin's interface.

#### Header Area

![PitchGridPluginUI](images/PG_HeaderArea.png "1100")

The header area contains the following components:

- PitchGrid Logo: Clicking on the logo takes you to this guide.
- MIDI Input Menu: Select the type of input MIDI signal.
- Presets Menu: Acces factory and user presets. 
- Preset Management: Create new presets, save changes to the current preset or delete a preset.
- MIDI Output Menu: Select the type of output MIDI signal.
- Settings Menu: Some other settings.

#### Control Area

![PG_ControlArea](images/PG_ControlArea.png "1100")

The control area allow you to configure the scale, its tuning and the mapping to the piano keyboard, and to control the pitch ruler:

- Scale & Tuning
  - Depth: Select the MOS hiearchy level of your scale (does not affect tuning).
  - Root Freq: Set the frequency of the root note. All frequency ratios relative to the root note are preserved.
  - Stretch: Proporionally stretch the whole scale. 
  - Skew: Skew the 2-dimensional lattice which hosts your scale. This is the most important tuning parameter. It may change the scale's structure in significant ways.
  - Optimize: Allows you to optimize your tuning, i.e. to automatically adjust the tuning parameters Stretch and Skew in order to minimize the distance of selected notes in the lattice to pitches in the ruler area.  
- Piano Mapping
  - Mode Offset: Offsets the lattice vertically. Affects both mapping and the scale's mode.
  - Steps: Number of steps per equave to be mapped onto MIDI note numbers.
- Pitch Ruler Marks: Control the Marks displayed on the ruler. 
  - Prime Limit: Ruler shows just intervals of small frequency ratios. Select the small primes that are allowed to appear in a ratio and the maximum integer that should be considered.
  - Harmonic Series: Ruler shows harmonic overtone freqquency ratios of a deeper pitch, of which the root note is the n-th harmonic.
  - Equal divisions: Divides the equave into n equal steps. If the equave is set to the 2:1 ratio (octave), which is the default setting, then the marks correspond to equal divisions of the octave (EDOs).

> Info: The pitch ruler marks do not affect the tuning. They serve as an orientation allowing to better judge the harmonic properties of the scale and to find suitable parameters.

#### Info Area

![PG_InfoArea](images/PG_InfoArea.png "1100")

The info area displays some basic properties of the scale:
- MOS System: Number of large and small steps between consecutive scale degrees, and the mode.
- Large Step: Size of the large scale step (L) in cents.
- Small Step: Size of the small scale step (s) in cents.
- Chroma: Size of a postitive accidental (c), always equal to L-s, in cents.
- Equave: Size of the equave (E) (interval after which the scale structure repeats) in cents. 
- Generator: Size of the generator (G) in cents. The generator is always the node closest to the horizontal line connecting the root with the equave up from that line. All nodes in the lattice may be thought of as integer multiplies of the generator modulo the equave.   
- Step Sequence: The concrete sequence of large and small steps of the chosen scale. The diatonic major scale (Ionian mode) has the cyclically repeating sequence LLsLLLs.

#### Pitch Ruler Area

![PG_RulerArea](images/PG_RulerArea.png "1100")

The pitch ruler area shows ruler marks of interest. What it displays depends on the Pitch Ruler Marks configuration settings (see above). When selecting a node for optimization, that node becomes associated with the closest ruler mark. When the "Snap to Ruler Marks" feature is used, pitches of the mapped nodes within the equave are adjusted to match the closest ruler mark. This allows to easily configure just intonations (JI), harmonic sequence intonations (HEJI) and [equal step tunings](https://en.xen.wiki/w/Equal-step_tuning) (e.g. EDOs).  

#### PitchGrid Area

![PG_GridArea](images/PG_GridArea.png "1100")

The PitchGrid area displays a portion of the rank-2 regular temperament lattice, hosting the chosen scale. In PitchGrid, a scale is a path on a 2d lattice. Small steps in the scale are associated with one direction, large steps with another. The steps are connecting consecutive scale degrees and thereby form a zig-zag pattern. By construction, the number of large and small steps is always coprime. For example, 5 and 2 have no common prime factors. Also, the steps are distributed equally. These constraints give rise to $n_L+n_s$ different modes (or cyclic permutations of the scale sequence pattern), depending on where the pattern starts. At the one extreme, the scale degrees are chosen as sharp as possible: large steps are more to the left and small steps more to the right (e.g. Lydian mode). At the other extreme it's the converse, the scale is flat (e.g. Locrian mode).

Every node is labeled by a scale degree (letter or number) and its accidentals. The naming convention is fully compatible with our sheet music notation system, whatever parameters are chosen. One can think of the PitchGrid area as a window into the lattice of the infinite number of available nodes, i.e. scale degrees and all their accidentals. 

The root note and its equivalents are yellow, other scale degrees are white, and off-scale nodes within the window are grey.

#### Piano Mapping Area

![PG_MappingArea](images/PG_MappingArea.png "1100")

This area shows the mapping of the nodes on the portion of the 2d lattice displayed in the PitchGrid area onto a conventional piano keyboard MIDI controller. Every key is connected to exactly one node. The keys display the input MIDI note number that will trigger a note, its note label (same as the mapped node's label), and its designated pitch according to the tuning parameters. Root notes, scale degrees and mapped off-scale notes are colored as on the lattice. 

When the scale conforms to the diatonic scale structure and the mapping is set to include 12 steps per equave, the mapping nicely matches the piano keyboard layout: On-scale notes are white keys and off-scale notes are black keys. When the tuning paramters are outside the diatonic range, the piano keyboard layout does not fit anymore. Via the coloring scheme, the PitchGrid plugin tries to make it somewhat easier to identifying the keys on a conventional keyboard. 

However, isomorphic controllers might be better suited to allow playability. If you happen to own a LinnStrument, the open source [PitchGrid-Linnstrument-Companion App](https://github.com/peterjungx/pg-linn-companion/releases/tag/v0.1.1) allows to dynamically highlight the pads of the LinnStrument according to the configuration in the PitchGrid.

I am currently working on enabling other isomorphic controllers to be configured in a similar way. Stay tuned. 


### Basic Operation Principle

PitchGrid is a MIDI effect plugin designed specifically for creating and playing different scales. The idea is to convert the MIDI signal from a controller and to re-tune it according to the desired settings in a way that a synthesizer then generates the desired pitches:

![PG_Basic_Operation](images/PG_Basic_Operation.png "1100")

_Fig 2. Basic principle of operation of the PitchGrid Plugin_ 

The input is an untuned MIDI or MPE signal, and the output is a tuned MIDI or MPE signal. The PitchGrid Plugin decouples its input from its output, so it is possible to use regular MIDI synths with MPE controllers, or sensibly re-tune an MPE capable synth using a regular MIDI controller.

> FAQ: Why does PitchGrid not support Scala files? Answer: The industry standard for tuning is the use of Scala (.scl) files. In recent years, multiple DAWs started supporting them. The concept is to create scales in a separate scale building software and to export whatever static tuning one has generated as a file to be used by a synth or a DAW. PitchGrid offers scale generation, pitch relationship visualization and mapping to the controller all in one place. The tuning parameters are exposed to the host DAW, which means that the tuning parameters can be dynamically changed in the course of a composition using automation. PitchGrid was born out of a frustration with the static nature of Scala files, and I feel that working with files is not a suitable approach for the future of microtonality in general. 

### Interface Elements for Input and Output

The input and output


Configure the input to match the type of the signal for the 





Unlike traditional microtonal plugins, PitchGrid uses knobs to retune the whole scale, making sure that pitch relationships are structurally consistent. Its flexible lattice system is inspired by meantone and just intonation principles. It generalizes the structure of the Western tonal system, including the familiar sheet music notation logic, and extends it to any MOS scale and Just Intonation "approximations" thereof. The tuning parameter knobs are exposed to the host DAW and thereby allow real-time tuning adjustments during your composition or performance.

The PitchGrid plugin processes incoming MIDI notes and pitch bend data from your controller (a raw, or untuned MIDI signal) and transforms it into a tuned MIDI MPE signal, making sure that your synth is playing the right pitches. Alternatively, PitchGrid also can serve as an MTS-ESP master, sending out tuning information to other plugins and synths in your DAW.

PitchGrid is available in VST3 and AU formats, as well as a standalone application, ensuring compatibility with some of the most popular DAWs. (Unfortunately, Bitwig Studio is an exception, as it has a special handling of MPE signals that conflicts with the way PitchGrid works.)

### Purpose
The primary goal of PitchGrid is to democratize the use of alternative musical scales. No more struggling with cumbersome retuning or limited preset scales—PitchGrid empowers you to design your own tunings visually and hear them in real-time. It's perfect for genres like ambient, experimental, world music, and contemporary classical where non-standard tunings add emotional depth and harmonic richness. It also makes it easier than ever for you to kick off your own genre based on a new scale implying its own music theory and your own harmonic rules.  

### Key Benefits
- **Visual Tuning Design**: Drag, select, and optimize pitches on an interactive lattice for intuitive scale creation.
- **Seamless DAW Integration**: Supports VST3 and AU formats, working natively in popular DAWs like Ableton Live, Logic Pro, and Reaper.
- **Advanced MIDI Handling**: Full support for MPE (MIDI Polyphonic Expression), polyphonic aftertouch, and MTS-ESP (Multipitch Tuning Standard - Extended Scale Pricing) for professional workflows.
- **Real-Time Performance**: Low-latency processing ensures tuning changes are instantly reflected in your playing.
- **Preset Library**: Start with factory presets for common tunings like 12-TET, Pythagorean, and 31-TET, then save your own.

If you see a black screen or WebView loading, wait a moment for the interface to initialize.

### Basic Interface Tour
The PitchGrid interface is divided into three main areas: the Pitch Grid (center), Controls (sides), and Toolbar (top).

- **Toolbar**:
  - Preset dropdown: Load/save tunings.
  - MIDI I/O indicators: Green lights show active input/output.
  - License status: Shows trial days left or "Activated."
  - Help button: Access this manual and tooltips.

- **Pitch Grid (Central Lattice)**:
  - A hexagonal or square grid visualizing pitches as nodes.
  - Horizontal axis: Octaves or generators (e.g., perfect fifths).
  - Vertical axis: Another generator (e.g., major thirds).
  - Selected nodes glow blue; play them to hear the tuning.
  - Zoom/pan with mouse wheel or trackpad.

- **Left Panel - Tuning Parameters**:
  - Dials for Steps, Offset, Depth, Skew, Stretch, Base Tune.
  - Adjust these to shape your scale—changes update the grid instantly.

- **Right Panel - MIDI Settings**:
  - Input Mode dropdown: Regular MIDI or MPE.
  - Output Mode: Choose Mono, Poly, MPE, or MTS.
  - Channel selectors and pitch bend range sliders.

- **Bottom Bar**:
  - Status messages (e.g., "MTS Connected").
  - OSC/Network toggle for advanced control.

**Step-by-Step First Tune**:
1. Load the default preset (12-TET).
2. Play a C major scale on your keyboard—notes should sound in standard tuning.
3. Turn the "Steps Mapped" dial to 19 (for 19-TET). The grid updates, and your playing now uses 19 equal steps per octave.
4. Select a few nodes on the grid (click to highlight) to create a custom mode.
5. Save as "My First Tuning" via the preset menu.

**Tip**: Hover over any control for a tooltip explaining its function. Use the spacebar to toggle play/pause for testing without your DAW.

**Warning**: High "Depth" values (>5) can create very dense grids—zoom out to navigate.

## The Pitch Grid

The heart of PitchGrid is the Pitch Grid, a visual map of musical intervals that makes tuning design as easy as drawing.

### Lattice Visualization
The grid is a lattice diagram where each node represents a pitch class relative to the root. By default, it's a meantone-style lattice:
- **Generators**: The horizontal axis uses the "fifth" generator (702 cents in 12-TET), vertical uses the "third" (386 cents).
- **Nodes**: Small circles or hexagons, colored by interval quality (consonant green, dissonant red).
- **Lines**: Connect related pitches; thickness shows strength of relationship.

As you adjust parameters, the lattice morphs—nodes move to reflect the new tuning ratios.

### Node Selection
Click nodes to select/deselect them for your active scale:
- **Single Click**: Toggle a node on/off.
- **Shift+Click**: Select a range (e.g., for a mode).
- **Ctrl+Click (Cmd on Mac)**: Multi-select non-adjacent nodes.
- Selected nodes form your playable scale; unselected ones are silent or detuned.

The grid shows 3-7 octaves by default, but you can scroll to explore more.

### Optimization
Once nodes are selected, click the "Optimize" button (magnifying glass icon) to refine the tuning:
- **What it Does**: Minimizes beating and maximizes consonance within your constraints (e.g., pure fifths).
- **Options**: Choose "Best Fit" for overall smoothness or "Pure Octaves" to lock 2:1 ratios.
- **Result**: Nodes snap to optimal positions; a preview plays the scale automatically.

**Tip**: Start with a simple selection like the Pythagorean comma (7 fifths up) to hear the wolf interval resolve.

**Warning**: Optimization can alter your manual selections—save a copy first via presets.

## Tuning Parameters

PitchGrid's parameters let you fine-tune your lattice with precision. All are accessible via dials in the left panel, with values shown in cents or ratios.

### Steps Mapped
- **Range**: 3-36 steps per octave.
- **Default**: 12 (standard semitones).
- **How to Adjust**: Turn the dial or type a value. This sets how many divisions fit in an octave.
- **Effect**: Higher steps create finer microtonal divisions (e.g., 31 for Bohlen-Pierce approximations).
- **Tip**: For xenharmonic scales, try 19 or 22 steps—listen for smooth melodies.

### Offset
- **Range**: 0-1 (fraction of the generator cycle).
- **Default**: ~0.458 (5/12 for fifth-based).
- **How to Adjust**: Drag the dial; the grid rotates visually.
- **Effect**: Shifts the mode's starting point on the lattice, useful for modal interchange.
- **Example**: Offset 0 starts on the root; 0.5 inverts the scale.

### Depth
- **Range**: 0-7 layers.
- **Default**: 3.
- **How to Adjust**: Increase to add more octaves/generators.
- **Effect**: Expands the lattice depth, revealing higher harmonics or extended modes.
- **Tip**: Keep at 3-4 for performance; higher for composition exploration.

### Skew
- **Range**: 0.5-1 (asymmetry factor).
- **Default**: ~0.583.
- **How to Adjust**: Skew the dial to tilt the lattice.
- **Effect**: Distorts the grid for asymmetric tunings, like skewed meantone.
- **Warning**: Extreme skew (>0.9) can make navigation tricky—use zoom.

### Stretch
- **Range**: 0.1-2.2 (compression/expansion).
- **Default**: 1.0 (linear).
- **How to Adjust**: Stretch the dial outward for expansion.
- **Effect**: Scales intervals non-linearly, simulating piano stretch or electronic detuning.
- **Tip**: 1.1-1.2 adds warmth to acoustic simulations.

### Base Tune
- **Range**: A=415-466 Hz (or -100 to +100 cents from 440).
- **Default**: 440 Hz.
- **How to Adjust**: Fine-tune the root frequency dial.
- **Effect**: Sets the reference pitch for the entire tuning.
- **Example**: 432 Hz for a relaxed, historical feel.

**Step-by-Step Adjustment**:
1. Set Steps to your base division (e.g., 12).
2. Adjust Offset to position your tonic.
3. Increase Depth for range.
4. Fine-tune Skew and Stretch for timbre.
5. Set Base Tune last.

All changes update in real-time—play along to hear!

## MIDI Input and Output

PitchGrid excels at transforming MIDI data for microtonal performance. Configure I/O in the right panel.

### Configurations
- **Input**: Receives standard MIDI notes (0-127) or MPE data.
- **Output**: Remaps to your tuning, sending note-ons, pitch bends, and poly pressure.
- **Routing**: Input from DAW/keyboard; output to synths on the same track.

### Input Modes
- **Regular MIDI**: Standard note + velocity + pitch bend (global).
  - Select via dropdown.
  - Pitch Bend Range: 1-96 semitones (default 12); adjusts sensitivity.
- **MPE**: Polyphonic expression per note.
  - Enable for controllers like Seaboard.
  - Input Pitch Bend Range: Separate control for per-note bends.
  - Pitch Bend Mode: "Toward Scale" (bends to nearest note) or "Along Mapped" (follows grid paths).

**Tip**: For MPE, ensure your controller sends on multiple channels (e.g., 1-15).

### Output Modes
Choose how tuned MIDI is sent:
- **None**: Processes internally for visualization only.
- **Mono**: Single channel output with pitch bend for microtones.
  - Channel: 1-16.
- **Poly**: Multi-channel notes (up to 16 voices).
  - Start/End Channel: Define range (e.g., 1-8 for octophonic).
- **MPE**: Polyphonic output with per-note expression.
  - Zone: Lower (ch 1 master, 2-16 members) or Upper (ch 16 master, 1-15 members).
  - Num Channels: 1-15 voices.
- **MTS-ESP**: Integrates with MTS master (see Advanced Features).

**Avoid Duplicates**: Toggle to prevent multiple notes on the same output channel—useful for poly modes.

**Step-by-Step Setup**:
1. Set Input Mode to match your controller.
2. Choose Output Mode (start with MPE for expressivity).
3. Adjust channels to avoid conflicts with other tracks.
4. Test: Play a glissando—pitch bends should follow your tuning.

**Warning**: In Poly mode, exceeding channel limits mutes notes. Monitor the status bar.

## Preset Management

Presets let you save and recall tunings quickly.

### Loading/Saving
- **Load**: Dropdown in toolbar > Select preset > Click "Load."
- **Save**: "Save As" > Name it > Choose thumbnail (auto-generated from grid).
- **Overwrite**: Right-click a preset > "Overwrite."

Presets store tuning parameters and node selections, but not global MIDI settings.

### Factory Presets
Start with these:
- **12-TET**: Standard Western tuning.
- **Pythagorean**: Pure fifths with wolf intervals.
- **1/4-Comma Meantone**: Renaissance consonance.
- **Just Intonation**: Pure intervals based on harmonics.
- **19-TET**: Bright, smooth alternative.
- **Bohlen-Pierce**: Acoustic scale in 3:5:7 ratios.
- And more—over 20 included.

Thumbnails show a mini lattice preview.

**Tip**: Organize into banks (e.g., "Xenharmonic," "Historical") via the preset editor.

**Warning**: Factory presets are read-only—duplicate before editing.

## Advanced Features

For pros, PitchGrid offers deep integration options.

### MTS-ESP Integration
MTS-ESP allows sharing tunings across plugins.
- **Enable**: Set Output Mode to MTS.
- **Master/Slave**: PitchGrid can act as master (broadcasts tuning) or slave (follows external master).
- **Setup**: Install MTS-ESP master plugin first; PitchGrid auto-detects.
- **Benefits**: Sync tunings across instruments in your project.

If conflict (another master), a dialog prompts to resolve.

### OSC Control
Open Sound Control for remote parameter tweaks.
- **Enable**: Toggle "OSC" in bottom bar.
- **Port**: Default 8000 (incoming), 8001 (outgoing).
- **Mapping**: Send `/pitchgrid/steps 19` to set steps to 19.
- **Apps**: Use TouchOSC or Lemur on iPad for wireless control.

Broadcasts status changes to connected clients.

### Networking
Share your grid view:
- **WebSocket Server**: Auto-starts on load (port 5174+).
- **Connect**: From browser or app, go to `ws://localhost:5174`.
- **Features**: Remote node selection, parameter control, live playing notes.
- **Use Case**: Collaborate with a tuner while you perform.

**Tip**: Firewall may block—allow incoming on the port shown in status.

**Warning**: Networking is local-only; no internet required.
